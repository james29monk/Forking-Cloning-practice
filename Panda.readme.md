Forking/Cloning Practice
 - In this exercise you need to put into practice your skills using the terminal/CLI.
 - Like before move the outside .txt file into the practice directory.

 ***Dont Forget your git commands to add, commit, and push your code back to github after this step***

 - Now navigate inside of the practice-directory 
 - Now add your name inside the file

 ***Again add, commit, and push your code to your repo***

 Take a look at github. Does the repo on github have the "move-me-to-practice.txt" file moved correctly? Did you add your name into the "your-name.txt" file? 

 If you did it correctly GREAT JOB!!!!! 
 If it doesnt then ask for help. Dez, Eddie or Zach
